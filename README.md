# focus-blocks
The basic idea here is an app that implements a neurofeedback / mindfulness system using only basic I/O computer data as opposed to biometrics, webcam input etc. To track how focused a user is on a task and allow them to hone in on it. 

A general "mindfulness assistant" in the atomic sense, where as a domain/application blocker would be slightly wider.

## The System Shall
- Log mouse movement, clicks, and position.
- Log keyboard activity
- Log high level window / application / OS activity
- Use this data to track how engaged with or focused on a task the user is.
- Provide feedback to the user to improve focus and engagement.
